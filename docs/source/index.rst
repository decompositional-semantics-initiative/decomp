Decomp: A toolkit for decompositional semantics
===============================================

Decomp_ is a toolkit for working with the `Universal Decompositional
Semantics (UDS) dataset`_, which is a collection of directed acyclic
semantic graphs with real-valued node and edge attributes pointing
into `Universal Dependencies`_ syntactic dependency trees.

The toolkit is built on top of NetworkX_ and RDFLib_ making it
straightforward to:

  - read the UDS dataset from its native JSON format
  - query both the syntactic and semantic subgraphs of UDS (as well as
    pointers between them) using SPARQL 1.1 queries
  - serialize UDS graphs to many common formats, such as Notation3_,
    N-Triples_, turtle_, and JSON-LD_, as well as any other format
    supported by NetworkX

The toolkit was built by `Aaron Steven White`_ and is maintained by
the `Decompositional Semantics Initiative`_. The UDS dataset was
constructed from annotations collected by the `Decompositional
Semantics Initiative`_.

If you use either UDS or Decomp in your research, we ask that you cite the following paper:
